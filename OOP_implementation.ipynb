    "By defining an abstract base class, you can define a common API for a set of subclasses. This capability is especially\n",
    "useful in situations where a third-party is going to provide implementations, such as with plugins to an application, but can also aid you when working on a large team or with a large code-base where keeping all classes in your head at the same time is difficult or not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) If a class inherits an abc class, it has to define all the functions declared in the abstract base class. Else the compiler will automatically indicate which child class has not done so\n",
    "\n",
    "2) an abstract base class class can't instantiate of it's own object\n",
    "\n",
    "3) the abstract base class class is created as an instance of the ABCMeta class which is defined in abc module of python\n",
    "\n",
    "4) to define an abstract method, we have to use the @abstractmethod decorator"
